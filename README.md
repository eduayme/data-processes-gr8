# Movies
## Domain of interest
People are generally interested in movies, so we have thought that is an interest domain to choose for doing this assignment. We also want to explore different relationships between the attributes of distinct films.

We have found some data science projects related to this domain. Some of them are:

- [Data science analysis of movies released in the cinema between 2000 and 2017](https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/data-science-analysis-of-movies-released-in-the-cinema-between-2000-and-2017-b2d9e515d032 "Data science analysis of movies released in the cinema between 2000 and 2017")
- [The most influential factor of imdb movie rating part in data scraping](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-most-influential-factor-of-imdb-movie-rating-part-i-data-scraping-61dc0c4dd518 "The most influential factor of imdb movie rating part in data scraping")
-  [What makes a successful film predicting a films revenue and user rating with machine learning?](https://towardsdatascience.com/what-makes-a-successful-film-predicting-a-films-revenue-and-user-rating-with-machine-learning-e2d1b42365e7 "What makes a successful film predicting a films revenue and user rating with machine learning?")
- [Analyzing Movie Scores on IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes](http://rstudio-pubs-static.s3.amazonaws.com/336722_2193716117584b63a2a6ebb837217d85.html "Analyzing Movie Scores on IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes")

Some example of questions that we will try to find are:
- What attributes makes the film better (with better we refer to the money earned, the popularity, the ratings)?
- Does the duration of film influence the average of users rating?
- Are some film genres more popular than others? Have it changed during years?
- Have old films better critic scores than recent ones?
- Can a film earn a more than 1 billion dollars if the genre is not one of the top3 popular gender in that year?
- The release year influences in the popularity and revenue of a movie?
