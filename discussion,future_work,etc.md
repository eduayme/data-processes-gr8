Discussion:
The implications of the research are directly related with the film industry or the film critics. The success (votes and views) of the film is influenced by the revenues, date or the duration of the film.

TODO: 
---Añadir lo que se ha descubierto más en concreto, explorando

Future work:
The future work could be divided, mainly, in two main fields:

On one hand, the idea is to explore other possible relations between attributes, for example between the title length and the average vote. Hence, we could find answers to newer questions, like, for example, if the title of the film influences the positive votes or the total views of the film. Even more, we could find the semantic similarities between the words of the title of the most popular films.

On the other hand, the exploration of new algorithms to use, in order to predict with more accuracy, could be a more technical part of the future work. Not only the use of other machine learning techniques but also  the employment of deep learning, smarter statistics, etc.
